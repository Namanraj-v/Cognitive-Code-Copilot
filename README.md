## ## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

You need to run the backend and frontend servers in two separate terminals.

### ### Terminal 1: Start the Backend Server
```bash
# Make sure your virtual environment is active
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```
The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### ### Terminal 2: Start the Frontend App
```bash
